Current state:

1.Generate and run different scenarios, including random scenarios and specific ones like "High Pressure", "Resource Scarcity", and "Complex Tasks". (WIP)

2.Activate the AGENTSTORM feature, which simulates creative brainstorming sessions on various topics related to technology and innovation.

3.Set up projects using a basic prompt system, where users can specify the project type (e.g., App, Game) and provide a description.

## Features:

- Multi-agent system with specialized roles and expertise
- Dynamic task creation, assignment, and management
- Interactive GUI for real-time project monitoring
- Scenario simulations for different project types (Apps, Games, etc.)
- AGENTSTORM feature for creative brainstorming sessions
- Customizable project setups and agent configurations

## Setup Instructions

To run MasterMindGPT-2, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9.13 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/).

2. Clone this repository

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install the required libraries:
pip install customtkinter tkinter

5. Run the script:
python Main.py

## How to Use:

1. Run the script: `Main.py`
2. Click "Start with prompt" to begin a new project
3. Enter your project description and select the project type
4. Watch as AI agents collaborate to plan, execute, and review tasks
5. Use the GUI to monitor progress, add tasks, and interact with the system

Perfect for software developers, project managers, and AI enthusiasts looking to explore advanced project management simulations and multi-agent systems.
